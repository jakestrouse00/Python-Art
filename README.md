# Python Chaotic Art

## What is this?

This project was created because of a computer science class I had. In this class,
we were introduced to the Turtle library for Python. I was pretty quickly mystified
the capabilities of Turtle. I started off by making simple shapes. Then
I got the idea to start adding randomization. At first I just randomized the shapes themselves,
randomizing the lengths and angles of the shapes. Then I decided to try and randomize
the colors of the shapes. At first one shape would be entirely one color, but then
I made it so each side was its own color. Then I added shading to the randomization.
 
## What does this make?

I would like to say this makes art, but I guess that is up to interpretation.
This program makes random shapes with randomly shaded color sides indefinitely. This
makes what I would say are really cool designs if the program is left to run for a while.


## "Art" created with this program

My first complete piece. This was created with the colors red, blue, purple, and yellow. This was made on a white background, with a screen
size of 2048 x 2048

This is my second large scale time consuming peice. This was created when testing new colors and color shades. This piece used
red, blue, purple, yellow, green, orange, and hot_colors. Hot_colors are just a mix of very neon colors that I wanted to test out to
see if they worked well. And I can say I am pretty satisfied. This was drawn on a white background and had a screen size of 2048 x 2048

This peice was created when testing using a black background instead of a white one. I found the images turned out very nice with
a black background, and gave nice contrast. However, the only disappointing part about using a black background, is I found the background
usually didn't extend all the way when rendering the images from eps files to jpeg. This image was created with red, blue, yellow, and purple.
the screen size of this piece was 512 x 512.

## A couple things to note

* Saves created by this program are saved as .eps files. Eps files are not images, and are actually just text. To get an image 
from an eps file, I suggest using [EPS Viewer](https://epsviewer.org/ "EPS Viewer"). I used EPS Viewer when rendering all of my images, and it does a
pretty good job. 

* Images with large screen sizes and lots of filling can take some time to be created. My [first piece](https://i.ibb.co/pvG0KWw/final-background.jpg "My first image")
was made on a VPS (a remote computer) for over 24 hours straight. Making cool images takes time and patience, don't try and rush it.
